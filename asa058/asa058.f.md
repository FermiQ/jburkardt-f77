# asa058.f

## Overview

This file `asa058.f` contains the Fortran subroutine `clustr`, which implements the K-means clustering algorithm (Applied Statistics Algorithm AS 58). Given a set of multi-dimensional observations and initial cluster centers, the algorithm assigns each observation to the nearest cluster and then re-calculates the cluster centers. This process is repeated until no observations change clusters. The file also includes the standard `timestamp` utility.

## Key Components

### Functions/Subroutines

- **Name:** `clustr` (SUBROUTINE)
  - **Description:** Performs Euclidean K-means cluster analysis. It aims to partition `i` observations (each with `j` variables) into `n` clusters by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares. The routine iteratively assigns observations to the nearest cluster centroid and then updates the centroids based on the new memberships.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `x(i,j)`: (DOUBLE PRECISION array, Input) The matrix of observed data, where `i` is the number of observations and `j` is the number of variables.
    - `d(k,j)`: (DOUBLE PRECISION array, Input/Output) On input, the initial estimates for the `k` cluster centers (where `k` is the max number of clusters, and `n` is the target number of clusters). On output, the final cluster centers.
    - `i`: (INTEGER, Input) The total number of observations.
    - `j`: (INTEGER, Input) The number of variables (dimensions) for each observation.
    - `n`: (INTEGER, Input) The desired number of clusters to form.
    - `nz`: (INTEGER, Input) The minimum number of observations that a cluster is allowed to contain. If a cluster size drops below `nz`, observations might not be reassigned from it.
    - `k`: (INTEGER, Input) The first dimension of arrays `d`, `dev`, `e` (maximum number of clusters these arrays can hold).
  - **Output Parameters:**
    - `dev(k)`: (DOUBLE PRECISION array) For each of the `n` active clusters, the sum of squared Euclidean distances of its member observations from the cluster's center.
    - `b(i)`: (INTEGER array) For each observation, the index (1 to `n`) of the cluster to which it has been assigned.
    - `e(k)`: (INTEGER array) For each of the `n` active clusters, the number of observations assigned to it.
  - **Workspace:**
    - `f(i)`: (DOUBLE PRECISION array) Used internally to store the squared distance of each observation to its current cluster center, adjusted by a factor related to cluster size.
  - **Returns:** [Subroutine - outputs via parameters.]

- **Name:** `timestamp` (SUBROUTINE)
  - **Description:** Prints the current system date and time in a human-readable format to standard output.
  - **Parameters:** None.
  - **Returns:** [Subroutine - writes to standard output.]

## Important Variables/Constants

- **`big`**: (DOUBLE PRECISION PARAMETER in `clustr`)
  - **Value:** `1.0D+10`
  - **Purpose:** A large number used to initialize minimum distance calculations when assigning observations to clusters.
- **Algorithm Logic:**
  1. **Assignment Step:** Each observation is assigned to the cluster whose current center `d(cluster,variable)` is nearest (Euclidean distance).
  2. **Update Step:** Cluster centers `d` are recalculated as the mean of the observations assigned to them.
  3. **Reassignment Check:** Observations are checked to see if they should be moved to a different cluster based on the new centers. The process iterates until no observations are reassigned in a full pass.
  4. **Minimum Cluster Size `nz`**: If a cluster's observation count `e(cluster)` is less than or equal to `nz`, its members are not considered for reassignment in that iteration's reassignment check.

## Usage Examples

```fortran
! Example for clustr:
!      INTEGER I_OBS, J_VAR, N_CLUST, NZ_MIN, K_MAX
!      PARAMETER (I_OBS=100, J_VAR=2, N_CLUST=3, K_MAX=5, NZ_MIN=1)
!
!      DOUBLE PRECISION X_DATA(I_OBS, J_VAR), D_CENTERS(K_MAX, J_VAR)
!      DOUBLE PRECISION DEV_OUT(K_MAX), F_WORK(I_OBS)
!      INTEGER B_ASSIGN(I_OBS), E_COUNTS(K_MAX)
!
!      ! ... Initialize X_DATA with observation data ...
!      ! ... Initialize D_CENTERS with initial guesses for N_CLUST cluster centers ...
!      ! (e.g., pick N_CLUST random observations as initial centers)
!      ! For example, if N_CLUST = 3:
!      ! D_CENTERS(1,1)=X_DATA(1,1); D_CENTERS(1,2)=X_DATA(1,2)
!      ! D_CENTERS(2,1)=X_DATA(2,1); D_CENTERS(2,2)=X_DATA(2,2)
!      ! D_CENTERS(3,1)=X_DATA(3,1); D_CENTERS(3,2)=X_DATA(3,2)
!
!      CALL CLUSTR ( X_DATA, D_CENTERS, DEV_OUT, B_ASSIGN, F_WORK, E_COUNTS,
!     &              I_OBS, J_VAR, N_CLUST, NZ_MIN, K_MAX )
!
!      PRINT *, 'Cluster assignments (B):'
!      PRINT *, (B_ASSIGN(IDX), IDX=1,I_OBS)
!      PRINT *, 'Final cluster centers (D):'
!      DO IDX = 1, N_CLUST
!         PRINT *, 'Cluster ', IDX, ' Center: ', (D_CENTERS(IDX,JV), JV=1,J_VAR)
!         PRINT *, 'Count in Cluster ', IDX, ': ', E_COUNTS(IDX)
!         PRINT *, 'SumSqDev for Cluster ', IDX, ': ', DEV_OUT(IDX)
!      END DO
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **System Routine:** `DATE_AND_TIME(DATE_STR, TIME_STR)` is used by `timestamp`.
- **Intrinsic Fortran Functions:** `REAL`.
- The quality of the final clustering can depend on the initial choice of cluster centers in `d`.
- The file `asa058/asa058_prb.f` (not part of this core file analysis) would typically contain test programs.
[This section should be fairly complete for this algorithm.]
