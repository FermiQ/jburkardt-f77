# asa113.f

## Overview

This file `asa113.f` contains Fortran subroutines `swap` and `trnsfr`, which are part of Applied Statistics Algorithm AS 113. These routines are designed for non-hierarchical classification (clustering). They aim to improve an existing classification of objects by iteratively reallocating objects between classes to minimize a user-defined criterion. The file also includes the standard `timestamp` utility.

The actual calculation of the criterion change for a potential swap or transfer, and the update of cluster-specific data if a swap/transfer is made, must be handled by user-supplied external subroutines (`crswap` and `crtran` respectively).

## Key Components

### Functions/Subroutines

- **Name:** `swap` (SUBROUTINE)
  - **Description:** Iteratively considers swapping pairs of objects between different classes. If a swap (object `i` from class `L` to class `M`, and object `j` from class `M` to class `L`) results in a reduction of the criterion value (determined by calling `crswap`), the swap is performed, and relevant data (class assignments, criterion value) are updated. The process continues until no more beneficial swaps are found.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `varval(in,iv)`: (DOUBLE PRECISION array, Input) Data matrix (objects x variables).
    - `class(in)`: (INTEGER array, Input/Output) Object class assignments.
    - `clsize(ik)`: (INTEGER array, Input/Output) Number of objects in each class.
    - `in`: (INTEGER, Input) Number of objects.
    - `ik`: (INTEGER, Input) Number of classes.
    - `iv`: (INTEGER, Input) Number of variables.
    - `critvl`: (DOUBLE PRECISION, Input/Output) The criterion value to be minimized.
  - **Output Parameters:**
    - `ntrans`: (INTEGER) Number of swaps performed.
    - `ifault`: (INTEGER) Error flag (0: success; 1: ik < 2; 2: in < ik).
  - **External Dependencies:** Calls user-supplied subroutine `crswap`.

- **Name:** `trnsfr` (SUBROUTINE)
  - **Description:** Iteratively considers transferring individual objects from their current class to any other class. If a transfer results in a reduction of the criterion value (determined by calling `crtran`), the transfer is performed. The process continues until no more beneficial transfers are found.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `varval(in,iv)`: (DOUBLE PRECISION array, Input) Data matrix.
    - `class(in)`: (INTEGER array, Input/Output) Object class assignments.
    - `clsize(ik)`: (INTEGER array, Input/Output) Class sizes.
    - `in`, `ik`, `iv`: (INTEGER, Input) Dimensions.
    - `critvl`: (DOUBLE PRECISION, Input/Output) Criterion value.
  - **Output Parameters:**
    - `ntrans`: (INTEGER) Number of transfers performed.
    - `ifault`: (INTEGER) Error flag (0: success; 1: ik < 2; 2: in < ik).
  - **External Dependencies:** Calls user-supplied subroutine `crtran`.

- **Name:** `timestamp` (SUBROUTINE)
  - **Description:** Prints the current system date and time.
  - **Parameters:** None.

## Important Variables/Constants

- **`eps`**: (DOUBLE PRECISION PARAMETER in `swap` and `trnsfr`)
  - **Value:** `1.0D-38`
  - **Purpose:** A small positive tolerance. A swap or transfer is only considered beneficial if it reduces the criterion value by more than `eps`.
- **`iswitch`** (INTEGER, local in `swap` and `trnsfr`):
  - **Purpose:** Used as a flag when calling `crswap` or `crtran`.
    - `iswitch = 1`: Request `crswap`/`crtran` to calculate the change in criterion (`inc`) if the swap/transfer were made, but don't actually perform it.
    - `iswitch = 2`: Request `crswap`/`crtran` to update any internal class statistics because a swap/transfer has been decided.

## Usage Examples

```fortran
! Conceptual example for using TRNSFR (SWAP would be similar):
!
!      EXTERNAL MY_CRTRAN_ROUTINE ! User must provide this
!      INTEGER CLASS_ASSIGN(NOBJ), CLASS_SIZES(NCLUST)
!      DOUBLE PRECISION DATA_VALS(NOBJ, NVARS), CRITERION_VAL
!      INTEGER NOBJ, NCLUST, NVARS, TRANSFERS_DONE, FAULT_CODE
!
!      ! ... Initialize DATA_VALS, CLASS_ASSIGN, CLASS_SIZES, NCLUST, ...
!      ! ... Calculate initial CRITERION_VAL based on initial classification ...
!
!      CALL TRNSFR ( DATA_VALS, CLASS_ASSIGN, CLASS_SIZES,
!     &              NOBJ, NCLUST, NVARS, CRITERION_VAL,
!     &              TRANSFERS_DONE, FAULT_CODE )
!
!      IF (FAULT_CODE .EQ. 0) THEN
!        PRINT *, 'TRNSFR completed. Transfers made: ', TRANSFERS_DONE
!        PRINT *, 'Final criterion value: ', CRITERION_VAL
!      ELSE
!        PRINT *, 'TRNSFR error, IFAULT = ', FAULT_CODE
!      END IF
!
!      ! User-supplied CRTRAN would look something like:
!      ! SUBROUTINE MY_CRTRAN_ROUTINE (VARVAL, CLASS, CLSIZE, IN, IK, IV,
!      !    CRITVL, IOBJ, M_FROM, L_TO, ISWITCH, INC)
!      !   ...
!      !   IF (ISWITCH .EQ. 1) THEN
!      !     ! Calculate hypothetical change 'INC' if IOBJ moves from M_FROM to L_TO
!      !   ELSE IF (ISWITCH .EQ. 2) THEN
!      !     ! Update internal class statistics because IOBJ has moved
!      !   END IF
!      !   RETURN
!      ! END
```
Examples of how to use the components in this file should be added here. The user needs to implement `crswap` and `crtran` which define the specific clustering criterion and how class properties (like centroids or scatter matrices) are updated.

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **User-Supplied Subroutines:**
  - `swap` requires an external subroutine `crswap(varval, class, clsize, in, ik, iv, critvl, i, j, l, m, iswitch, inc)`
  - `trnsfr` requires an external subroutine `crtran(varval, class, clsize, in, ik, iv, critvl, i, m, l, iswitch, inc)`
  These routines are critical as they define the clustering criterion being optimized.
- **System Routine:** `DATE_AND_TIME(DATE_STR, TIME_STR)` is used by `timestamp`.
- The file `asa113/asa113_prb.f` (not part of this core file analysis) would typically contain test programs and example implementations of `crswap` and `crtran`.
[This section highlights the crucial dependency on user-supplied `crswap` and `crtran`.]
