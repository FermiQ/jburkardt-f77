# anytty.f

## Overview

This file `anytty.f` contains Fortran code. Its specific purpose and role within the project need to be documented. It implements the ANYPLT graphics interface for a simple TTY (teletypewriter) or console text-based display.

## Key Components

### Functions/Subroutines

- **Name:** `ANYPLT`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Main TTY graphics interface. It uses a character array `SCREEN` to build a text-based representation of the plot, which is then printed to the console. Handles various `ICOM` commands for plotting operations.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `ICOM`: (INTEGER) Command code.
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

- **Name:** `XTOIX`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Converts a real X-coordinate from user space to an integer column index for the TTY `SCREEN` array.
  - **Parameters:** `IXMAX, IXMIN, X, XMAX, XMIN` (Screen/user coordinate limits and value).
  - **Output Parameters:** `IX` (INTEGER screen column index).
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

## Important Variables/Constants

- **Name:** `SCREEN(24,80)`
  - **Type:** CHARACTER*1 array (SAVE)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Buffer for the TTY plot. Each element holds one character to be displayed.
- **Name:** `IXMIN`, `IXMAX`, `IYMIN`, `IYMAX`
  - **Type:** INTEGER (SAVE)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Define the active character grid area for plotting within the `SCREEN` array.
- **Name:** `XMIN`, `XMAX`, `YMIN`, `YMAX`
  - **Type:** REAL (SAVE)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Define the user's logical coordinate system that maps to the character grid.
- **Name:** `/anycom/`, `/anychr/`
  - **Type:** COMMON blocks
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Share data (plot parameters, coordinates, strings like `CARRAY`) with calling routines.

## Usage Examples

Examples of how to use the components in this file should be added here.

## Dependencies and Interactions

Details on dependencies on other system parts or external libraries, and interactions with other components should be added here.
- Output is to standard Fortran output unit (console).
- Uses COMMON blocks `/anycom/` and `/anychr/`.
- Contains its own coordinate transformation logic (`XTOIX`).
