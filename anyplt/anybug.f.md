# anybug.f

## Overview

This file `anybug.f` contains Fortran code. Its specific purpose and role within the project need to be documented. It appears to be a debugging version of a graphics interface called ANYPLT.

## Key Components

### Functions/Subroutines

- **Name:** `anyplt`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] This subroutine acts as a graphics interface. Based on the input `icom`, it performs various actions, logging them to a debug file named `anyplt.bug`.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `icom`: (INTEGER) Command code determining the graphics action.
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

## Important Variables/Constants

- **Name:** `ldunit`
  - **Type:** INTEGER (PARAMETER)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Logical unit number for the debug output file.
- **Name:** `carray`
  - **Type:** CHARACTER*80 (COMMON /anychr/)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Used for character string data (e.g., text for plotting, version info).
- **Name:** `icom`
  - **Type:** INTEGER
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Input command code.
- **Name:** `iplt1`, `iplt2`
  - **Type:** INTEGER (COMMON /anycom/)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Likely plot-related integer parameters.
- **Name:** `ixplt1`, `ixplt2`
  - **Type:** INTEGER (COMMON /anycom/)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Likely X-axis related integer plot parameters.
- **Name:** `iyplt1`, `iyplt2`
  - **Type:** INTEGER (COMMON /anycom/)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Likely Y-axis related integer plot parameters.
- **Name:** `marray`
  - **Type:** INTEGER (COMMON /anycom/)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Likely related to array/string length for character data.
- **Name:** `xplt1`, `xplt2`
  - **Type:** REAL (COMMON /anycom/)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Likely X-axis related real plot parameters (e.g., coordinates, limits).
- **Name:** `yplt1`, `yplt2`
  - **Type:** REAL (COMMON /anycom/)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Likely Y-axis related real plot parameters (e.g., coordinates, limits).

## Usage Examples

Examples of how to use the components in this file should be added here.

## Dependencies and Interactions

Details on dependencies on other system parts or external libraries, and interactions with other components should be added here.
- Writes to an external file `anyplt.bug`.
- Uses COMMON blocks `/anycom/` and `/anychr/` which implies data sharing with other routines.
