# anynul.f

## Overview

This file `anynul.f` contains Fortran code. Its specific purpose and role within the project need to be documented. It provides a "null" or dummy version of the ANYPLT graphics interface, which performs no actual graphics operations but can return version information.

## Key Components

### Functions/Subroutines

- **Name:** `anyplt`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] This subroutine is a stub for a graphics interface. It does nothing for most command codes (`icom`). If `icom` is 13 (version request), it sets a version string in the `carray` common block variable.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `icom`: (INTEGER) Command code.
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

## Important Variables/Constants

- **Name:** `carray`
  - **Type:** CHARACTER*80 (COMMON /anychr/)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Used to return the version string.
- **Name:** `/anycom/`
  - **Type:** COMMON block
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Declared but its members are not actively used by this null routine for graphics. Contains `iplt1,iplt2,ixplt1,ixplt2,iyplt1,iyplt2,marray,xplt1,xplt2,yplt1,yplt2`.

## Usage Examples

Examples of how to use the components in this file should be added here.

## Dependencies and Interactions

Details on dependencies on other system parts or external libraries, and interactions with other components should be added here.
- No external graphics dependencies.
- Uses COMMON blocks `/anycom/` and `/anychr/`.
