# asa007.f

## Overview

This file `asa007.f` contains Fortran code. Its specific purpose and role within the project need to be documented. It includes `cholesky` for Cholesky decomposition (seemingly identical to AS 6 in `asa006.f`) and `syminv` (AS 7) for inverting a symmetric positive definite matrix using the Cholesky factor. A `timestamp` utility is also present.

## Key Components

### Functions/Subroutines

- **Name:** `cholesky`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Computes the Cholesky factorization (A = U<sup>T</sup>U) of a PDS matrix A. Input A is lower triangular packed by rows; output U is upper triangular packed by columns.
  - **Parameters:** `a` (DOUBLE PRECISION array, input), `n` (INTEGER, input), `nn` (INTEGER, input).
  - **Output Parameters:** `u` (DOUBLE PRECISION array, output), `nullty` (INTEGER, output), `ifault` (INTEGER, output).
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

- **Name:** `syminv`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Computes the inverse of a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix A using its Cholesky decomposition.
  - **Parameters:** `a` (DOUBLE PRECISION array, input - PDS matrix), `n` (INTEGER, input - order of A).
  - **Output Parameters:** `c` (DOUBLE PRECISION array, output - inverse of A), `nullty` (INTEGER, output - rank deficiency from Cholesky), `ifault` (INTEGER, output - error flag).
  - **Workspace:** `w(n)` (DOUBLE PRECISION array).
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

- **Name:** `timestamp`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Prints the current date and time.
  - **Parameters:** None.
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

## Important Variables/Constants

- **Name:** `eta` (in `cholesky`)
  - **Type:** DOUBLE PRECISION (PARAMETER)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Small positive value (1.0D-09) for numerical stability.
- **Name:** `a` (in `cholesky`, `syminv`)
  - **Type:** DOUBLE PRECISION array
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Stores the input matrix (packed lower triangular).
- **Name:** `u` (in `cholesky`), `c` (in `syminv`)
  - **Type:** DOUBLE PRECISION array
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] `u` stores the Cholesky factor; `c` stores the final inverse matrix. `c` is also used to receive `u` from `cholesky`.

## Usage Examples

Examples of how to use the components in this file should be added here.

## Dependencies and Interactions

Details on dependencies on other system parts or external libraries, and interactions with other components should be added here.
- `syminv` calls the `cholesky` subroutine (which is present in this file).
- `timestamp` calls system routine `date_and_time`.
- Matrix data is expected in a specific packed triangular format.
