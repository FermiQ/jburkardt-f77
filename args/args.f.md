# args.f

## Overview

This file `args.f` contains Fortran code. Its specific purpose and role within the project need to be documented. It includes a main program that demonstrates reading command-line arguments and a `timestamp` subroutine.

## Key Components

### Functions/Subroutines

- **Name:** `main` (PROGRAM)
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Demonstrates the use of `iargc()` to get the count of command-line arguments and `getarg()` to retrieve each argument. It then prints these arguments.
  - **Parameters:** None explicitly, but it reads command-line arguments.
  - **Returns:** [This is a program.]

- **Name:** `timestamp`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Prints the current date and time to the standard output.
  - **Parameters:** None.
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

## Important Variables/Constants

- **Name:** `arg`
  - **Type:** CHARACTER * ( 80 )
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Stores a command-line argument.
- **Name:** `i`
  - **Type:** INTEGER
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Loop counter for arguments.
- **Name:** `numarg`
  - **Type:** INTEGER
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Stores the number of command-line arguments.
- **Name:** `month` (in `timestamp`)
  - **Type:** CHARACTER * ( 9 ) array(12) (SAVE, DATA statement)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Stores names of months for timestamp output.

## Usage Examples

Examples of how to use the components in this file should be added here.
```fortran
! To compile and run (e.g., gfortran):
! gfortran args.f -o args_example
! ./args_example test1 "another arg" 123
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

Details on dependencies on other system parts or external libraries, and interactions with other components should be added here.
- Relies on intrinsic or system-provided functions `iargc()` and `getarg(integer, character_variable)`.
- The `timestamp` subroutine relies on a system-provided `date_and_time(date_string, time_string)` subroutine.
