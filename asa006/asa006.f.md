# asa006.f

## Overview

This file `asa006.f` contains Fortran code. Its specific purpose and role within the project need to be documented. It includes routines for Cholesky decomposition of a positive definite symmetric matrix: `cholesky` (AS 6) and `subchl` (related to AS R44 for submatrices), along with a `timestamp` utility.

## Key Components

### Functions/Subroutines

- **Name:** `cholesky`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Computes the Cholesky factorization (A = U<sup>T</sup>U) of a PDS matrix A. Input A is lower triangular packed by rows; output U is upper triangular packed by columns.
  - **Parameters:** `a` (DOUBLE PRECISION array, input), `n` (INTEGER, input), `nn` (INTEGER, input).
  - **Output Parameters:** `u` (DOUBLE PRECISION array, output), `nullty` (INTEGER, output), `ifault` (INTEGER, output).
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

- **Name:** `subchl`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Computes Cholesky factorization for a submatrix of A, selected by indices in `b`. Also returns the determinant.
  - **Parameters:** `a` (DOUBLE PRECISION array, input), `b` (INTEGER array, input), `n` (INTEGER, input), `ndim` (INTEGER, input).
  - **Output Parameters:** `u` (DOUBLE PRECISION array, output), `nullty` (INTEGER, output), `ifault` (INTEGER, output), `det` (DOUBLE PRECISION, output).
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

- **Name:** `timestamp`
  - **Description:** [Brief description of function/subroutine purpose and parameters] Prints the current date and time.
  - **Parameters:** None.
  - **Returns:** [This is a subroutine.]

## Important Variables/Constants

- **Name:** `eta` (in `cholesky` and `subchl`)
  - **Type:** DOUBLE PRECISION (PARAMETER)
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] A small positive value (1.0D-09) for numerical stability checks.
- **Name:** `a` (in `cholesky`, `subchl`)
  - **Type:** DOUBLE PRECISION array
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Stores the input matrix (packed lower triangular).
- **Name:** `u` (in `cholesky`, `subchl`)
  - **Type:** DOUBLE PRECISION array
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Stores the output Cholesky factor (packed upper triangular).
- **Name:** `b` (in `subchl`)
  - **Type:** INTEGER array
  - **Purpose:** [Brief description of variable/constant purpose] Specifies row/column indices for submatrix selection.

## Usage Examples

Examples of how to use the components in this file should be added here.

## Dependencies and Interactions

Details on dependencies on other system parts or external libraries, and interactions with other components should be added here.
- `timestamp` calls system routine `date_and_time`.
- Matrix data is expected in a specific packed triangular format.
